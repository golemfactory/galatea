The Queen has conducted her first in-person royal duty since her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, died on Friday.

The monarch hosted a ceremony in which the Earl Peel formally stood down as Lord Chamberlain, whose office organises royal ceremonies.

During a private event held at Windsor Castle, the Queen accepted her former royal aide's wand and office insignia.

The Royal Family is observing two weeks of mourning. The duke's funeral will take place at Windsor on Saturday.

A royal official said members of the family would continue "to undertake engagements appropriate to the circumstances".
